          <p class="heading">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 - The Lord will come and meet His people at the second coming</p>
          <p>"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with <br>the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught <br>up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."</p>
          <p class="heading">1 Thessalonians 5:4-6 - We should prepare for Christ's coming</p>
          <p>"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of <br>light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as do <br>others; but let us watch and be sober."</p>
          <p class="heading">2 Thessalonians 2:13-14 - Through the gospel we can obtain eternal glory</p>
          <p>"But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath <br>from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: <br>Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
