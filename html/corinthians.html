          <p class="heading">1 Corinthians 1:17 - God doesn't require powerful individuals to preach the gospel</p>
          <p>"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross <br>of Christ should be made of none effect."</p>
          <p class="heading">1 Corinthians 6:19-20 - We honor God as we honor our bodies</p>
          <p>"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have <br>of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, <br>and in your spirit, which are Godâ€™s."</p>
          <p class="heading">1 Corinthians 12:23-26 - All types of people are needed in Christ's church</p>
          <p>" And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more <br>abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. For our comely parts have <br>no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part <br>which lacked: That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same <br>care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member <br>be honoured, all the members rejoice with it."</p>
