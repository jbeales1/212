          <p class="heading">Hebrews 7:24-28 - Jesus Christ is the Great High Priest</p>
          <p>"But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able <br>also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make <br>intercession for them. For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate <br>from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to <br>offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the peopleâ€™s: for this he did conce, when he <br>offered up himself. For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the <br>oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore."</p>
          <p class="heading">Hebrews 12:6-11 - God disciplines us for our benefit</p>
          <p>"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure <br>bchastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth <br>not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. <br> Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: <br>shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a <br>few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers <br>of his holiness. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless <br>afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."</p>
