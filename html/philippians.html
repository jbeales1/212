          <p>"Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better <br>than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let <br>this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:"</p>
          <p class="heading">Philippians 3:7-9 - Coming to know Christ is what matters most</p>
          <p>"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I <br>count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have <br>suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, And be found in him, <br>not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the <br>righteousness which is of God by faith:"</p>
