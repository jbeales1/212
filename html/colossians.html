          <p>"Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of <br>his dear Son:in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who <br>is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, <br>that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, <br>or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things,<br> and by him all things consist."</p>
          <p class="heading">Colossians 2:13-15 - Jesus redeemed us</p>
          <p>"And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together <br>with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances <br>that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; And <br>having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it."</p>
