          <p class="heading">Revelation 1:17-18 - Jesus promises us that He lives and holds the keys of death</p>
          <p>"And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear <br>not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, <br>Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death."</p>
          <p class="heading">Revelation 3:15-16 - We need to be firmly committed to Christ</p>
          <p>"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou <br>art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth."</p>
          <p class="heading">Revelation 21:6-7 - We will inherit all the Father has if we overcome the world</p>
          <p>"And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him <br>that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I <br>will be his God, and he shall be my son."</p>
