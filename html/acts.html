          "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up <br>from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven." <br>
        <p class="heading">Acts 10:43 - All prophets testify that Jesus is the Christ</p>
        <p>"To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him <br> shall receive remission of sins."</p>
        <p class="heading">Acts 5:11, 15-16 - The Apostles heal many in Christ's name</p>
        "And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people...<br> Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches,<br> that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. There came <br>also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them <br>which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one."
