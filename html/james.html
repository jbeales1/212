          <p>"Behold, we put bits in the horsesâ€™ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole <br>body. Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are <br>they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. Even so the tongue is<br> a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the <br>tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole <br>body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."</p>
          <p class="heading">James 1:5-6 - If we lack wisdom we can ask of God</p>
          <p>"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth <br>not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is <br>like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed."</p>
