          <p>"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an <br>advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins: and <br>not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world."</p>
          <p class="heading">1 John 2:3-6 - If we love God, we will keep His commandments</p>
          <p>"And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, <br>and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, <br>in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. He that saith he abideth <br>in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."</p>
            <p class="heading">1 John 4:19-21 - We must love our brethren to love God</p>
            <p>"We love him, because he first loved us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he<br> that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this <br>commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also."</p>
