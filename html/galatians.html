          <p class="heading">Galatians 1:11-12 - The gospel of Jesus Christ is received by revelation</p>
          <p>"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. For I <br>neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."</p>
          <p class="heading">Galatians 3:26-29 - We are God's children and Abraham's seed</p>
          <p>"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been <br>baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond<br> nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ’s,<br> then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise."</p>
          <p class="heading">Galatians 5:22-23 - The fruit of the Spirit</p>
          <p>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, <br>meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</p>
