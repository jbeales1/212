          <p>"As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: <br>But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; Because it is <br>written, Be ye holy; for I am holy."</p>
          <p class="heading"> 1 Peter 4:12-14 - We should expect and rejoice in our persecutions for Christ's sake</p>
          <p>"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange <br>thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christâ€™s sufferings; that, when <br>his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name <br>of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil <br>spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</p>
